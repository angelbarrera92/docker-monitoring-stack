# Example override file for advanced networking scenarios
# Copy to docker-compose.override.yml and customize
#
# Usage: docker compose up -d
# (Docker Compose automatically merges docker-compose.override.yml)

# =============================================================================
# OPTION 1: Host network mode (for VPN access - Tailscale/WireGuard/OpenVPN)
# =============================================================================
# Uncomment below to give Prometheus direct access to host network interfaces.
# This allows scraping targets over VPN tunnels (tailscale0, wg0, tun0, etc.)
# Note: Port mapping is ignored in host mode (Prometheus always on port 9090)
#
# services:
#   prometheus:
#     network_mode: host

# =============================================================================
# OPTION 2: Join an existing Docker network from another stack
# =============================================================================
# Use this if you have another compose stack that created a network you need.
# For example, a Tailscale container stack or a shared services network.
#
# services:
#   prometheus:
#     networks:
#       - default
#       - shared
#
# networks:
#   shared:
#     external: true
#     name: my-other-stack_network  # The actual Docker network name
